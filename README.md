# Distributed Local Outlier Factor (LOF) Algorithm

The Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm is used to detect anomalies or outliers in a dataset based on the density relationships of data points in their neighborhoods. It quantifies the local deviation of a data point with respect to its neighbors. The algorithm can be implemented in a distributed setting using the HPCC Systems platform.

## Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set MinPts (number of neighboring points) and con (contamination ratio).

2. **Find k-Nearest Neighbors (kNNs):**
   - For each data point `pi` in dataset `D`:
     - Determine its kNNs based on proximity.
     - Calculate k-distance of `pi` using its kth nearest neighbor.

3. **Calculate Reachability Distances:**
   - For each point `pi` and its kNNs `t`:
     - Compute reachability distance `Rdis(pi, t)` using k-distance and actual distance.

4. **Calculate Local Reachability Density (LRD):**
   - Calculate LRD of each point `t` as the inverse of average reachability distance with its kNNs.
   - Calculate LRD of `pi` similarly.

5. **Calculate LOF for each point:**
   - Calculate LOF of each point `pi` considering its LRD and LRDs of its kNNs.
   - LOF is the ratio of average density of `pi`'s neighbors to `pi`'s density.

6. **Identify Anomalies:**
   - Sort LOF values in descending order.
   - Select top N points with the highest LOF values as anomalies based on the contamination ratio.

7. **Distributed Implementation in HPCC Systems:**
   - Choose a data partitioning strategy for distribution among nodes.
   - Build k-d trees on each node using the entire dataset (unsegmented) or a partition (segmented).
   - Query k-d trees on each node to find local kNNs for each data point.
   - Combine local kNNs across nodes to obtain global kNNs.

8. **Calculate k-Distance and Reachability Distances:**
   - Calculate k-distance for each point based on its global kNNs.
   - Calculate reachability distances for all points based on their global kNNs.

9. **Calculate LRD and LOF for each point:**
   - Calculate LRD for each point using reachability distances.
   - Calculate LOF for each point using its LRD and LRDs of its global kNNs.

10. **Identify Anomalies in Distributed Setting:**
    - Sort LOF values in descending order.
    - Select top N points with the highest LOF values as anomalies.

This algorithm is a powerful tool for anomaly detection and can be applied to various domains where outlier detection is crucial. Its distributed implementation in the HPCC Systems platform allows for efficient processing of large datasets across multiple nodes, enhancing scalability and performance.
